## IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW CARD ACCOUNT

To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Cambodia law, requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens a Card Account. What this means for you: When you open a Card Account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask to see a copy of your national ID or passport, or other identifying documents.

### Activate Your Card

Your Card must be activated. To activate your Card, launch the mobile application associated to your card.  Click on Activation.  Or request to have an activation link sent to your mobile device.

### Personal Identification Number

After you activate your Card via the mobile application, you will request to set a 6 digit PIN. You should not write or keep your PIN with your Card. Never share your PIN with anyone. When entering your PIN, be sure it cannot be observed by others and do not enter your PIN into any terminal that appears to be modified or suspicious. If you believe that anyone has gained unauthorized access to your PIN, you should advise us immediately following the procedures in the paragraph labeled "Your Liability for Unauthorized Transfers." At any time, you can launch your application to disable the card or reset the PIN.

### Authorized Card Users

You are responsible for all authorized transactions initiated and fees incurred by use of your Card. If you permit another person to have access to your Card or Card number, we will treat this as if you have authorized such use and you will be liable for all transactions and fees incurred by those persons. You are wholly responsible for the use of each Card according to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

### Secondary Cardholder

You may not request an additional Card for another person. Each family member must have their own Card Account.

### Your Representations and Warranties

All ATM transactions are treated as cash withdrawal transactions.

### Loading Your Card

You may add funds to your Card, called "value loading", at any time. The minimum amount of the initial value load is US$$5.00$. The Card must be loaded for at least the minimum amount at the time the Card is purchased at the branch location. The minimum amount of each value reload is US$$5.00$ via agent partner or online via the consumer website. The maximum amount of the initial value load at the time of Card purchase is US$$500.00$ at the agent partner location. The maximum amount of each value reload is US$$2,500.00$. Online via the consumer website the maximum reload amount is US$$500.00$ per transaction; up to US$2,500.00 per day.

### Using Your Card/Features

The maximum amount that can be spent on your Card per day is US$$2,500.00$. The maximum value of your Card is restricted to US$$2,500.00$. You may use your Card to purchase or lease goods or services everywhere UnionPay cards or BONGLOY cards are accepted as long as you do not exceed the value available on your Card Account. Some merchants do not allow cardholders to conduct split transactions where you would use the Card as partial payment for goods and services and pay the remainder of the balance with another form of legal tender. If you wish to conduct a split transaction and it is permitted by the merchant, you must tell the merchant to charge only the exact amount of funds available on the Card to the Card. You must then arrange to pay the difference using another payment method. Some merchants may require payment for the remaining balance in cash. If you fail to inform the merchant that you would like to complete a split transaction prior to swiping your Card, your Card is likely to be declined. If you use your Card at an automated fuel dispenser ("pay at the pump"), the merchant may pre-authorize the transaction amount up to US$99.00 or more. If your Card is declined, even though you have sufficient funds available, pay for your purchase inside with the cashier. If you use your Card at a restaurant, a hotel, for a car rental purchase, or for similar purchases, the merchant may pre-authorize the transaction amount for the purchase amount plus up to 15% or more to ensure there are sufficient funds available to cover tips or incidental expenses incurred. Any pre-authorization amount will place a "hold" on your available funds until the merchant sends us the final payment amount of your purchase. Once the final payment amount is received, the preauthorization amount on hold will be removed. It may take up to ten (10) days for the hold to be removed. During the hold period, you will not have access to the pre-authorized amount.

For security reasons, we may limit the amount or number of transactions you can make on your Card. Your Card cannot be redeemed for cash. You may not use your Card for online gambling or any illegal transaction.

Each time you use your Card, you authorize us to reduce the value available in your Card Account by the amount of the transaction and any applicable fees. You are not allowed to exceed the available amount in your Card Account through an individual transaction or a series of transactions.

Nevertheless, if a transaction exceeds the balance of the funds available on your Card, you shall remain fully liable to us for the amount of the transaction and any applicable fees.

You do not have the right to stop payment on any purchase or payment transaction originated by use of your Card. If you authorize a transaction and then fail to make a purchase of that item as planned, the approval may result in a hold for that amount of funds for up to thirty (30) days. 

### Returns and Refunds

If you are entitled to a refund for any reason for goods or services obtained with your Card, you agree to accept credits to your Card for such refunds and agree to the refund policy of that merchant. The Issuer is not responsible for the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspects of goods or services that you purchase from others with a Card. All such disputes must be addressed and handled directly with the merchant from whom those goods or services were provided.

### Card Replacement

If you need to replace your Card for any reason, please return to a branch of the financial institution where the Card was purchased to obtain an immediate replacement, or contact us at +855(0)23 532 0888 to request a replacement Card be mailed to you. You will be required to provide personal information which may include your Card number, full name, transaction history, etc. There is a fee for replacing your Card. Refer to the fee schedule provided within this document.

### Card Transfers

You may transfer funds to another card on the program.

### Transactions Made In Foreign Currencies

If you obtain your funds or make a purchase in a currency other than the currency in which your Card was issued, the amount deducted from your funds will be converted by BONGLOY into an amount in the currency of your Card. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by BONGLOY from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which may vary from the rate BONGLOY itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. 

### Receipts

You should get a receipt at the time you make a transaction using your Card. You agree to retain, verify, and reconcile your transactions and receipts.

### Card Account Balance/Periodic Statements

You are responsible for keeping track of your Card Account available balance. Merchants generally will not be able to determine your available balance. It’s important to know your available balance before making any transaction. You may obtain information about the amount of money you have remaining in your Card Account by calling +855(0)23 532 0888 or viewing the available balance in the App.

### Fee Schedule

All fee amounts will be withdrawn from your Card Account and will be assessed as long as there is a remaining balance on your Card Account, except where prohibited by law. Anytime your remaining Card Account balance is less than the fee amount being assessed, the balance of your Card Account will be applied to the fee amount resulting in a zero balance on your Card Account.

### Confidentiality

We may disclose information to third parties about your Card or the transactions you make:
(1)     Where it is necessary for completing transactions;
(2)     In order to verify the existence and condition of your Card for a third party, such as merchant;
(3)     In order to comply with a government agency, court order, or other legal or administrative reporting requirements;
(4)     If you consent by giving us your written permission;
(5)     To our employees, auditors, affiliates, service providers, or attorneys as needed; or
(6)     Otherwise as necessary to fulfill our obligations under this Agreement.

### Our Liability for Failure to Complete Transactions

If we do not properly complete a transaction from your Card on time or in the correct amount according to our Agreement with you, we will be liable for your losses or damages. However, there are some exceptions. We will not be liable, for instance:
(1)    If through no fault of ours, you do not have enough funds available on your Card to complete the transaction;
(2)     If a merchant refuses to accept your Card;
(3)     If an ATM where you are making a cash withdrawal does not have enough cash;
(4)     If an electronic terminal where you are making a transaction does not operate properly, and you knew about the problem when you initiated the transaction;
(5)     If access to your Card has been blocked after you reported your Card lost or stolen;
(6)     If there is a hold or your funds are subject to legal or administrative process or other encumbrance restricting their use;
(7)     If we have reason to believe the requested transaction is unauthorized;
(8)     If circumstances beyond our control (such as fire, flood, or computer or communication failure) prevent the completion of the transaction, despite reasonable precautions that we have taken; or
(9)     Any other exceptions stated in our Agreement with you.

### Your Liability for Unauthorized Transfers

Contact us at once if you believe your Card has been lost or stolen. Telephoning is the best way to minimize your possible losses. If you believe your Card has been lost or stolen, or that someone has transferred or may transfer money from your Card Account without your permission, call +855(0) 23 532 0888. If your Card has been lost or stolen, we will close your Card Account to keep losses down.

### Other Miscellaneous Terms

Your Card and your obligations under this Agreement may not be assigned. We may transfer our rights under this Agreement. Use of your Card is subject to all applicable rules and customs of any clearinghouse or other association involved in transactions. We do not waive our rights by delaying or failing to exercise them at anytime. If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable under any rule, law, or regulation of any governmental agency, the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement shall not be affected. This Agreement will be governed by the law of the Kingdom of Cambodia.

### Amendment and Cancellation

We may amend or change the terms and conditions of this Agreement at any time. You will be notified of any change in the manner provided by applicable law prior to the effective date of the change. However, if the change is made for security purposes, we can implement such change without prior notice. We may cancel or suspend your Card or this Agreement at any time. You may cancel this Agreement by returning the Card to us. Your cancellation of this Agreement will not affect any of our rights or your obligations arising under this Agreement prior to termination.

In the event that your Card Account is cancelled, closed, or terminated for any reason, you may request the unused balance to be returned to you via a check to the mailing address we have in our records. There is a fee for this service. Please refer to the fee schedule above. The Issuer reserves the right to refuse to return any unused balance amount less than $1.00.

### Information About Your Right to Dispute Transactions

In case of a discrepancy or questions about your electronic transactions, call +855(0)23 532 0888 or email.  You must contact us no later than sixty (60) calendar days after we posted the transaction(s) to the Card Account.

We will tell you the results in writing after completing our investigation. If we determine a discrepancy occurred we will correct the discrepancy promptly and credits the Card Account. If we decide there was no discrepancy, we will send you a written explanation.
