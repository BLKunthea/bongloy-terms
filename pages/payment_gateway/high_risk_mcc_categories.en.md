MCC stands for a Merchant Category Code, a four-digit number identifying the business classification depending on what type of products or services are provided by the merchant company. Below we have compiled a list of typical categories which acquirers and payment providers treat as high risk, imposing stricter approval terms and higher processing fees. Listed categories are known to generate higher chargeback disputes and fraud, as well as raise overall brand reputation risks. In addition there are specific MCC types for which the Card Associations (Visa, UnionPay) have established regulations by which the merchant has to be registered with them for the purpose of risk monitoring.
